**Note**
 Data is fetched for 7 days because only free endpoint providing 5-day weather report is based on 3hrs intervals. I assumed that the goal fo task is to show that I can send and handle calls with parameters and manipulate the given data. If that would be the issue lowering my overall score I can quickly modify it so it maps only 5 of given days.
